## What is RenderDragon?
According to [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/RenderDragon), it's a new rendering engine made for Minecraft Bedrock edition which replaces old OpenGL/DirectX engine.  

Render Dragon shaders are custom shaders created by modding Render Dragon files, enabling the application of custom shaders after official third-party shader support was discontinued with the introduction of Render Dragon.
